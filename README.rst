Author: Sujon Hekim

scikit-surgery-sphere-fitting is part of the `SciKit-Surgery`_ software project, developed at the `Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences`_, part of `University College London (UCL)`_.

scikit-surgery-sphere-fitting is tested on Python 3.7 but should support other modern Python versions.

scikit-surgery-sphere-fitting is currently a demo project, which will add/multiply two numbers. Example usage:

::

    python                                 a least squares sphere fitting algorithm,.py 5 8
    python                                 a least squares sphere fitting algorithm,.py 3 6 --multiply

Please explore the project structure, and implement your own functionality.
